        <p><strong>
            WITH a coastline of dramatic cliffs and pine forests, La Palma is one of the most beautiful of the Canary Islands.
        </strong> </p>
        <p>It is welcoming visitors again after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16187133/la-palma-volcano-canary-islands-eruption-news-live-latest/">last September’s eruption of Cumbra Vieja volcano</a> and 85 days of activity afterwards that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16182888/volcano-la-palma-eruption-destroys-homes-tourists-flee/">carpeted the island in ash</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Spring is a great time to go. Everything is green, the almond blossom is out and figs, oranges and lemons hang from the trees.
        </p>
        <p>Here are ten reasons to tick <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/16186472/where-is-la-palma/">La Palma</a> off your list...
        </p>

        <h2>Classic sight</h2>
        <p>THE Caldera de Taburiente is a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/4940841/la-palma-dangerous-place-on-the-planet/">volcanic crater almost five miles wide</a>, created by an eruption three million years ago.
        </p>
        <p>It is surrounded by 2,000m peaks, scattered with pine trees, while waterfalls stained red and orange tumble down the sides.
        </p>

        <h2>Fun neighbourhood</h2>
        <p>SANTA Cruz de la Palma is the compact capital and port.
        </p>
        <p>Start with a barraquito, a Canarian coffee liqueur drink with espresso and condensed milk. Then wander the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/7456608/la-palma-sicily-winter-sun-holiday-advice/">cobbled streets, lined with 15th-century colonial buildings</a> and their flower-filled balconies.
        </p>
        <p>The pedestrianised Calle O’Daly gets its name from an Irish banana merchant and has a colourful mix of shops.
        </p>

        <h2>The wow moment</h2>
        <p>HOME to the clearest skies in Europe, La Palma’s peaks, at 2,400 metres, boast a cluster of domes housing some of the world’s biggest telescopes, including the Gran Telescopio Canarias.
        </p>
        <p>They are not open to visitors at night but you can book a <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/11855986/lockdown-britain-stargazing-spots-night-skies/">stargazing</a> tour with Ad Astra La Palma. Imagine thousands of shimmering diamonds in the sky.
        </p>

        <h2>New for 2022</h2>
        <p>THE volcanic eruption may be over but there is still an exclusion zone, so hiking the slopes is out.</p>
        <p>But from a distance you can see smoke rising from the volcano and the fresh lava fields that carpet the hillside down to the sea.</p>

        <h2>Fantastic feast</h2>
        <p>ON the waterfront, many of pretty old houses have been converted into upmarket restaurants.</p>
        <p>La Lonja offers a mix of Canarian and Spanish cuisine, including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/18069416/valencias-golden-sands-paella-spain/">paella</a> and roasted cheese with mojo. Or nearby there is the Mercado Municipal, the largest market on the island, which offers tastings of Canarian delicacies.
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural fix</h2>
        <p>VISIT the impressive Iglesia del Salvador and admire its intricate 16th-century wooden ceiling, a great example of Islamic-style architecture.
        </p>
        <p>The Naval Museum, in a concrete replica of Columbus’s ship the Santa Maria, has a collection of model ships and navigational instruments.
        </p>

        <h2>Top tour</h2>
        <p>THE island is a protected Biosphere Reserve, so the coastal waters run clean and clear. Take a boat trip to see the Atlantic marine life, from turtles and flying fish to dolphins and pilot whales.
        </p>

        <h2>With the kids</h2>
        <p>THERE are no golden sands here. The shores are dark-grey due to volcanic rock but no less beautiful. The long, wide beach of Bajamar in the capital and the calm waters of Los Cancajos, just outside, are perfect for families.
        </p>
        <p>In the north is Charco Azul, a natural seawater pool enclosed by volcanic rocks and waterfalls which is safe for little ones to swim in. In February or March the quirky Los Indianos Festival sees locals dress in white and daub each other in talcum powder.
        </p>

        <h2>The grand hotel</h2>
        <p>THE 4* H10 Taburiente Playa seafront hotel is conveniently located between the airport and the capital. Take in the sea views from the restaurant’s terrace or relax beside the palm-tree lined pools.
        </p>
        <p>If you tire of sunbathing, it is only 200 yards from Playa de los Cancajos, with its dramatic black sand beaches and coastal promenade.
        </p>
        <p>For a unique stay, try the light-house near Barlovento on the north coast. It has rooms from around £200 per night. See <a href="floatel.de/en/hideaways/faro-cumplida">floatel.de/en/hideaways/faro-cumplida</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>One more treat</h2>
        <p>THE half-mile Palomas lava tube was formed during the 1949 eruption of the San Juan volcano, which is more of a cave than a tunnel.
        </p>
        <p>Guided tours supply safety equipment and you cross the lava flow before going underground.
